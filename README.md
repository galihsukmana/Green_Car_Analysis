# Green Car Analysis Visualization Project

Welcome to the repository for my Green Car Analysis Visualization Project! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to green cars, exploring their impact by watching the fuel consumption and emission level on the environment and their popularity in the automotive industry. The visualizations are created using Tableau and can be accessed on my Tableau Public profile.

## Introduction
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of green cars based on every cars specifications. The goal was to explore various aspects such as environmental benefits, stakeholders decision, and the correlation of each car specification in resulting carbon emission. Through compelling visualizations, I aimed to present the findings in an accessible and informative manner.

## Dataset
The analysis was performed on a comprehensive dataset that includes information on different car models, their specifications, fuel consumption, fuel type, gas emission, and highway preferences. The dataset was sourced from (Fuel_Consumption_2000-2022.csv) and was thoroughly cleaned and processed for visualization purposes. To access the dataset and reproduce the analysis, please follow the instructions provided in this repository.

## Tableau Public
I have shared the visualizations and interactive dashboards created during this analysis on my Tableau Public profile. You can explore the visualizations by visiting [my Tableau Public link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Dashboard_M1_Galih/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).


I have designed the visualizations to be intuitive and informative for both enthusiasts and stakeholders interested in sustainable transportation.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, feedback, or ideas for improving the analysis or visualizations, please feel free to reach out or submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and make this project even more insightful!
